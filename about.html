                <b>NOT YOUR SIN</b> is a name that came to me literally in a dream, and instantly I knew that it was the
                perfect name!
            </p>

            <p>Well, let me introduce myself. </p>

            <p>
                Maria is my name, and I am from a small country, born in an even
                smaller village (with only 100 inhabitants... believe it or not!). I grew up in a family of village-related
                professions, as you might imagine, but my passion for art was there since day zero. Our house is filled with
                paintings I did as a 10-year-old.
            </p>
            <p>
                Somehow though, I ended up getting a B.Sc. in Civil and Environmental
                Engineering, which I never used so far! In fact, in 2019 I went to beautiful Copenhagen to pursue my
                graduate studies in Materials Engineering. There it became fully apparent to me, as clear as the stars show
                in a clear night sky, that a rich Engineering career is not for me, because I kept feeling in distance with
                myself and my love for art. So I quit my master, and taught myself traditional art and digital design.
            </p>
            

            <p>
                I cannot imagine my life without creating. I love to experiment with lots of materials, not only
                paint and pixels. Currently, I am trying out Jesmonite and the journey is uncharted and exciting!
